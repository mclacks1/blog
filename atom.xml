    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Week 9:</p>

<p>Two more weeks to graduation, today is my 24th birthday and this will be my first accomplishments since graduating from high school.Words can&rsquo;t express how happy I will be when this class is DONE!!! I remember when I first started this class and I was told that there will be times where you feel like you want to quit and your mental capacity will be exhausted to the fullest. I feel like that completely and I appreciate my instructors who are being flexible with everything that&rsquo;s going on with my personal life. I totally dislike the fact that we chnaged the classroom location, but I&rsquo;m dealing with it because class is almost over. Right now I am giving all that I have to remain focused and finish the course. I am doing my best to communicate with my case managers, instructors, and classmates. They are a great help with keeping me up to date with the new project that we just started. There are some very smart young men in the class with awesome ideas and enjoy them sharing their advance knowledge and creativity.</p>

<p>Week 10:</p>

<p>This is our last week of class and I am beyond excited and mentally exhausted. Majority of my days, since I started this class, is spent trying to complete and correct assignments and projects that are somewhat complex, but it gives me an opportunity to be creative. I have learned a lot of information from this course and I enjoyed meeting all the different type of people from diverse backgrounds. Right now I am in a group with some very talented individuals that take pride in web development and graphic design and it is truly inspiring. I came up with a part of the project where I used my imagination with a fun spin on it. I got feedback from classmates and it was positive and made me feel like I was being a team player. So where ever this opportunity may take us I wish everyone well on their future endeavours. This has been a journey, more than like an adventure and I am forever grateful to be apart of YWEB because it has opened up doors for me. One more week until graduation!! Yesssss!</p>
